            <h2>I will try to keep this short and crisp. I am not great with writing stuff but still here it goes. It has been almost a year of knowing you and two months of being together, two months that I cherish the most. You have no idea how happy I am to have someone like you in my life </h2>
            <br><br/>
            <br><br/>
            <h2>Our long night calls are a thing I look forward to every single day. Here's to many more such memories in the coming future. I love you Ishika, can't wait to meet you soon :')</h2>
